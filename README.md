# wolf-company Project

Wolf Company technical project

# Overview

This is a simple project that calls a third party API and displays a list of Space X missions. The API results are limited to the last 10 records. Once the item is displayed on the screen, the user has the option to click on one of the Mission Names. Clicking on a mission name will take the user to a detail screen which provides further details about that Space X mission. Additionally the user has the ability to search for a specific mission by name.
